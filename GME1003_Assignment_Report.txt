Assignment Report

How many of steps 1-6 I got completed:
I completed all six steps successfully. I added a star sprite, created and drew multiple stars using lists, added random color, scale, transparency, and rotation values, and drew everything using MonoGame. I also set a black background and made sure everything rendered properly.

How I decided when to commit/push:
I committed after every meaningful milestone:
- After setting up the project and loading assets
- After creating the star list and drawing the first set of stars
- After adding random effects like color, transparency, and rotation
- After updating the background to black
- After fixing GitHub issues and finalizing the README

Each commit reflected actual progress and testing, not just tiny changes or pasting code.

How many commits/pushes I executed:
I made around 5–7 commits total. Each push was after a successful build and visual check of the changes. I avoided making too many tiny commits or doing one big commit at the end, because I wanted to follow a good workflow.

Specific troubles I had:
I had trouble pushing my local project to GitHub because the remote already had some files (like a README) that conflicted with mine. I got a merge conflict warning when trying to pull, and couldn’t push until I resolved it. This slowed me down and was really confusing until I got help.

How I used AI:
I used AI (ChatGPT) to:
- Help me understand and fix the GitHub push/pull/merge conflict
- Help me format my README and write proper commit messages
- Explain how to structure my commits and when to push
- Guide me through adding the drawing logic for the stars and effects in MonoGame

I didn’t just copy code — I learned from the explanations and used them to complete the work properly.
